Indeed, 2016 has already seen the worst bleaching ever recorded in Australia, with only 7% of the Great Barrier Reef left unscathed by some degree of bleaching impact, and over half of the corals experiencing bleaching there have died. The need for the public to understand these global impacts of climate change and potential risk of future loss of ecosystem function has never been higher.</p>

This app can serve as a resource for local residents, visitors, and the science community to monitor the short and long-term effects of bleaching.

                    <p class="text">This app has both a local and a larger-scale future. For the Hawaii version, there is a need to fully implement the planned functionalities. There is also a need to be able to integrate additional coral bleaching datasets collected by researchers and agencies to more accurately show and understand the current status and trends of the reefs as they experience and respond to bleaching. It would also be very valuable on several levels to be able to separately gather and display citizen science efforts to report bleaching through existing applications, such as Eyes on the Reef and the goFlow watersports app's coral bleaching reporting function, which is sponsored by the World Surf League.</p>

                    <p class="text">At a larger scale, it is critical to note that coral reef scientists themselves have no place to aggregate their observations. It is essential to be able to do this simply in order to fully understand the extent, intensity, and long-term effects of these devastating global coral bleaching events. In fact, even scientists who may be reluctant to share their more detailed experimental work are very likely to share their first-level bleaching observations in order to see their observations in context and collaborate with larger-scale syntheses. It is certainly the most urgent environmental question for coral reef scientists, and would be a major impetus for open data sharing on a worldwide scale. The application front end would still be focused on public outreach, but would allow scientific grade observations to populate the data tables displayed, and would even create the opportunity to capture historic localized coral bleaching data. There is currently no product that serves these important collaborative science and public information visualization capability for coral reef work. </p>

Even simplified, these datasets would need to be structured to offer affordances to report timing, extent of coral cover, extent of bleaching, species, and subsequent follow up to track recovery and mortality.</p>
