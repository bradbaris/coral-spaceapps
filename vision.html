Indeed, 2016 has already seen the worst bleaching ever recorded in Australia, with only 7% of the Great Barrier Reef left unscathed by some degree of bleaching impact, and over half of the corals experiencing bleaching there have died. The need for the public to understand these global impacts of climate change and potential risk of future loss of ecosystem function has never been higher.</p>

                    <p class="text">This app has both a local and a larger-scale future. For the Hawaii version, there is a need to fully implement the planned functionalities. There is also a need to be able to integrate additional coral bleaching datasets collected by researchers and agencies to more accurately show and understand the current status and trends of the reefs as they experience and respond to bleaching. It would also be very valuable on several levels to be able to separately gather and display citizen science efforts to report bleaching through existing applications, such as Eyes on the Reef and the goFlow watersports app's coral bleaching reporting function, which is sponsored by the World Surf League.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">At a larger scale, it is critical to note that coral reef scientists themselves have no place to aggregate their observations. It is essential to be able to do this simply in order to fully understand the extent, intensity, and long-term effects of these devastating global coral bleaching events. In fact, even scientists who may be reluctant to share their more detailed experimental work are very likely to share their first-level bleaching observations in order to see their observations in context and collaborate with larger-scale syntheses. It is certainly the most urgent environmental question for coral reef scientists, and would be a major impetus for open data sharing on a worldwide scale. The application front end would still be focused on public outreach, but would allow scientific grade observations to populate the data tables displayed, and would even create the opportunity to capture historic localized coral bleaching data. There is currently no product that serves these important collaborative science and public information visualization capability for coral reef work. </p>

            Community team builds Coral Beat App to raise awareness of coral bleaching<br/>

            A cross-functional community team comes together at the 1st NASA Space Apps Challenge held in Hawaii<br/>

            Honolulu (April 24, 2016) -- CoralBeat.org gets built over the weekend, starting on Earth Day, at the 5th Annual NASA Space Apps Challenge, the first challenge of its kind held in Hawaii. The cross functional community team consisted of citizen coders, science enthusiasts and subject matter experts from NOAA and the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology.<br/>

            CoralBeat (a reference to “heartbeat”) is an app focused on coral bleaching in Hawaii. Interactive mapping functionality includes years of NASA satellite data records depicting sea surface temperatures observed over the entire globe. An animation in the app shows how the ocean has warmed during the most recent El Niño event.<br/>

            With CoralBeat.org, a viewer can zoom into a coastal region around Hawaii to see the areas most impacted by coral bleaching. Upon closer inspection, a user can explore geo-referenced observations of impacted corals. Other interactive multimedia site functionality includes photos, videos and an interactive 3D reef scan.<br/>

            “Hawaii, along with the rest of the world, has now experienced three global coral bleaching events, two of them in the last two years, 2014 and 2015. This year is predicted to be warm enough to cause corals to lose their algal partners and bleach yet again, and three years in a row of this stress will be devastating for most corals. Right now in fact the Great Barrier Reef in Australia is experiencing massive coral bleaching and mortality - the worst they’ve ever experienced in recorded history,” said Dr. Ouida Meier of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology.<br/>

            The NASA Apps Challenge creates the opportunity for citizens to get involved in serving their community by using technology and science data to create new, innovative applications and platforms. In 2015 over 14,000 participants around the world developed nearly 1000 projects leveraging data from NASA.<br/>

            Participants gathered at the Manoa Innovation Center to use their diverse expertise and imagination to create innovative projects. The 2016 challenge categories included Technology, Aeronautics, Space Station, Solar System, Earth Live and Journey to Mars. Local projects can then be submitted to a global panel of judges to compete for several awards and win an invitation to NASA to attend a rocket launch.<br/>
